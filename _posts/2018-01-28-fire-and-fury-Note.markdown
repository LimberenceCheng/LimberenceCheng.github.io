## Introduction

This is an unofficial summary of the first year that President Trump took office, with many unofficial revelations about Trump and his side. Thanks to Book Review of The Economist, I have spent time on this so called, worth reading book. However, this book once again proves that the *Economist* is a second-rate commentary on this topic. Once again, people in the field of economics should not engage too much of their time in some particular issues that outside their ability circle. But you can still see, the theme of the Trump White House's court politics and management, chaos.

But I think this book is unreliable, it can be described as a collection of gossip.

### What kind of person is Trump in the end?

The book records many different people's emotional description, saying he is ignorant and incompetent, do not understand anything, do not want to read any reports, etc. I do not believe a word. 

The most serious source in the book is two points: first, his lack of basic planning and organizational capabilities, there is no way to concentrate on doing things; the second point is that his people infatuated with each other, only because they all think that Trump simply cannot be a president. The implication is that a large United States, but also rely on a group of sober aides insisted. Because of this broke the news, Trump also responded specifically on Twitter that he is "a very stable genius."

Trump **DON'T WANT TO WIN**. No one in the team thinks he'll win.  And because his lack of preparation, there's no administrative staff in the Trump's team! When Trump formed a team, various media expressed  their concern and majority of them were worry about this issue. Conway wondered how to push the responsibility to Puribas. "If we win, this will only be a problem," former national security adviser Michael Flynn assured his friends he decided to accept a $ 45,000 speech in Russia. But the result of this visit, he actually did not reported to the Vice President, which leads to his soon resignation.

The hardest hit was Steve Bannon, who said in the 2016 campaign Donald Trump Jr. had a meeting with the Kremlin's Russian lawyers, who denounced "enemies" "Not patriotic." Master Ba said: "If it is possible, he would smash Donald Jr. like an egg."

In fact, Trump is indeed a very successful salesman with outstanding sales skills, and understand how to grasp the psychology of consumers. So under his chief strategist Bannon packaging, Trump become ordinary people who work hard for the political fresh. However, during the White House's year, Trump exposed three important flaws: he was particularly in a false sense of pride, living in his own fantasies and a man live with lies and tales. He particularly dislikes the limelight of others particular in front of him. He was also very childish. In addition, he also particularly vulnerable to emotional things, no opinion, soft ears. All these shortcomings, many Americans worry about the nuclear button in his hand since he has boasted the powerful of this nuclear button many times.

### What is the rules of Trump White House game?

**IT IS F\*\*KING NO RULES!**

Above all, it does not have a well-functioning organizational structure. Again, Trump's campaign team has never considered winning one and has never made any preparations for governing. For example, Trump has never prepared a "handover team" like the other candidates before the election, setting up a minimum personnel team and preparing for succession after winning the election. Suddenly, "unprepared," a pounding of the sky, which won the election, meant that the Trump administration had been confused and dysfunctional from the very beginning.

Trump's White House does not have a normal organizational structure, and the most powerful chief of staff overrides his cronies around Trump. However, the Trump White House has a hidden rule that everyone knows, that is, who is closer to Trump, the greater the influence. So the staff around him all day long scrambling to turn around the main protagonist Trump, to meet his vanity, control of his flow of information, chewing his tongue in his ear. According to Wolf's description, the closer he is to Trump, the more his ideas, and Trump, too, is like an energetic child who enjoys the most to satisfy or distract him.
Because of his pet, Trump was credited with differentiating himself into three major factions, each in his own way attracting the president's attention. The first faction, led by Bannon, emphasized sparing no effort to implement alternative right-wing policies; one was a daughter-in-law party representing Wall Street and Big business interests, hope that Trump at least looks like a normal president for the daughter of the future to become the first female president to pave the way for the third party is the first White House chief of staff Puri Bass as the representative of the Republican system of school , Hoping to use Republican lawmakers to exchange Trump's humility for policy-making power.

### How much power Trump has been bound to?

The question of Trump's ability to assume the role of president of the United States is largely a concern that Trump will abuse his power and will make a blunder. 

Murdoch observes American politics for more than 50 years. After Trump was elected, Trump has sought advice from Murdoch. And Murdoch's proposal was simple, **the president seemed to have very powerful powers. However, once a new president took office, The time window for truly pushing our own policies is very limited.** Mr Murdoch said: "A president promoted the policy for as long as six months and up to its own agendas. What he can do afterward is to play the role of a fire captain and fight daily with the opposition parties."

However, a closer look at the Trump ruling experience described in this book, it is not difficult to find that Trump is bound and checks and balances is really not small. On the one hand, he wants to oppose the entire bureaucracy, which is not easy. On the other hand, any change of policy will move to some people's cheese. It is also difficult to balance various interests. Trump to promote their own policies or to help cronies for some benefits, will face the system and the balance of interests of the chain. From the very beginning of his administration, Bannon thought Trump could use his executive order to govern the country and the Congress and the bureaucracy, but found no chance of winning. When Trump wanted to revise a very small policy, he really found that pursuing politics was a compromise, that it was a transaction and that it was impossible to lose the will of Congress.
